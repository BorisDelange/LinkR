<!-- badges: end -->

cdwtools stands for **Clinical Data Warehouse tools**. This package aims to help clinicians, statisticians & data scientists work with CDW data, with data visualization, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis & model building tools, using a Shiny web application.

## Installation

<!--You can install the released version of cdwtools from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cdwtools")
```
-->

You can install the development version from Github, with :
``` r
devtools::install_github("BorisDelange/cdwtools")
```

## Overview

*Screenshot here*

The core principle of the App is the **modularity** : each user chooses which pages to display (called **modules** in the App), which **figures** display in each page, which **thesaurus items** each figure uses.

For example, a user can choose to display heart rate & systolic arterial blood pressure in a graph, in a page named *Haemodynamics*. This page will be automatically updated for each patient. He then creates a *Flowchart page* in Aggregated data, which will display a flowchart with the patients he has included & excluded. He finally creates a *Report page* where he can create a report of his work, choose which figures to display (dynamically update with modifications on data), and download it as a PDF.

The App contains two sides : a **user side**, which requires no particular skill in R and a **developper side**, where new plugins can be developped.
A **plugin** is a Shiny code used to render and manipulate data. Some plugins are available in the **Articles section** of this website. You can **create new plugins** and share it with other people.

## Deployment

The App can be deployed **locally** or installed on a **server**. See *Deploy the App on ShinyProxy* in Articles for more details.

## Security

The App uses [Shiny Manager](https://github.com/datastorm-open/shinymanager) to secure the access.
In the developper mode, you have direct access to the R environment and the database, so developper access must has to be used carefully.
It is recommended to install the App on a secure local server, as health data will be handled.
