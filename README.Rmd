## Introduction

**LinkR** is a web application that allows for visualization and analysis of health data.

The application is coded in R using the Shiny library. It uses the common data model <a href = "https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/" target = "_blank">OMOP</a>.

## Who is the application for?

The application is for:

- **clinicians**, an intuitive interface allows clinicians to analyze data and conduct studies without advanced programming knowledge
- **data scientists and statisticians**, LinkR provides access to a full R environment, allowing data scientists and statisticians to exploit all the features of advanced data analysis
- **healthcare students**, integrated tutorials in the application provide healthcare students with an opportunity to learn and practice data analysis in the healthcare field

Thus, LinkR facilitates **collaborative work**.

## Sharing and Open Science

LinkR is an **open source** application.

It contributes to **open science** by allowing the sharing of:

- *studies*: import and export your studies in one click, reproduce studies with your own data
- *scripts*: share interoperable scripts, thanks to the use of the common OMOP data model
- *plugins*: help improve the application by creating plugins and sharing them


## Installation

You can install the development version from Github, with:
``` r
remotes::install_github("BorisDelange/linkr")
```

The `remotes` library must be installed, you can install it with:
``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

## Launch the app

To launch the Shiny app, run:
```r
linkr::linkr(language = "en", app_folder = "My/App/Folder")
```

You can use the following arguments in the linkr function :

- *language*: choose in which the application will be launched ; "en" and "fr" are available
- *app_folder*: by default, application files are saved in the home folder (`path.expand("~")` to know which folder it is). You can change this folder by specifying the target folder in this argument.
- *local*: TRUE or FALSE to allow the app to access the internet
- *show_home_page*: TRUE or FALSE to show home pages (Overview, News, Tutorials... pages)

See `?linkr` for more informations.

The first load may take a few minutes to create the application database and download the default data.

## Contributions

LinkR **needs you** to evolve! You can contribute by creating plugins, or by helping to improve the application's code.
