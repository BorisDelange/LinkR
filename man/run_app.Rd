\arguments{
\item{language}{Language to use in the app (`"en"` or `"fr"`). (character)}

\item{app_folder}{Path to the folder where application files will be stored. (character)}

\item{authentication}{Should user authentication be enabled? (logical)}

\item{username}{Username to auto-connect with when `authentication = FALSE` (character). Ignored if authentication is enabled.}

\item{local}{If `TRUE`, runs the app in local mode without loading external files (e.g., from GitHub). (logical)}

\item{log_level}{Character vector of log levels to display. Can include `"info"`, `"error"`, `"event"`, or be set to `"none"` or an empty vector to disable logging.}

\item{log_target}{Destination for log messages: `"console"` or `"app"`. (character)}

\item{port}{Port used to run the Shiny app. (integer)}

\item{host}{Host address to run the app on. Default is `"0.0.0.0"`. (character)}

\item{loading_options}{A list of startup options (e.g., page, project, subset to load). Should include named elements like `page`, `project_id`, `load_data_page`, `subset_id`, `person_id`.}

\description{
Launches the LinkR Shiny application for health data science.
You can configure the interface language, authentication mode, runtime behavior, and logging preferences

Use `language` to set the application language (`"en"` or `"fr"`).

Use `app_folder` to define where LinkR will store application data and configuration files. 
If not specified, a `linkr` folder will be created in the user's home directory.

Use `username` to auto-connect as a specific user when `authentication = FALSE`. 
This allows you to bypass the login screen entirely during development or demo sessions.

Use `log_level` to control which log messages are displayed. It accepts a character vector containing any combination of:
`"info"` (standard information), `"error"` (errors only), and `"event"` (application lifecycle events).
To disable all logs, use `"none"` or leave the argument empty.

Use `log_target` to define where logs are displayed: `"console"` (developer mode) or `"app"` (to display logs in the LinkR interface).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run LinkR in English with default settings
run_app()

# Run LinkR in French
run_app(language = "fr")

# Specify a custom folder to store configuration and user data
run_app(app_folder = "~/my_linkr_data")

# Enable user authentication (will prompt login screen)
run_app(authentication = TRUE)

# Disable authentication and auto-connect as a predefined user
run_app(authentication = FALSE, username = "admin")

# Run the app in local mode (without loading from GitHub)
run_app(local = TRUE)

# Customize logging: show only info and error messages in the console
run_app(log_level = c("info", "error"), log_target = "console")

# Disable all logging
run_app(log_level = "none")

# Run the app on a custom host and port (e.g., for deployment)
run_app(host = "127.0.0.1", port = 8080)

# Automatically load a specific page or project at startup
# This is especially useful for online demos or when sharing a reproducible scenario

  page = "home",
  project_id = "project123",
  load_data_page = "patient_lvl",
