\arguments{
\item{language}{Language to use in the app (`"en"` or `"fr"`). (character)}

\item{app_folder}{Path to the folder where application files will be stored. (character)}

\item{authentication}{Should user authentication be enabled? (logical)}

\item{username}{Default username used for authentication (only relevant if `authentication = FALSE`). (character)}

\item{local}{If `TRUE`, runs the app in local mode without loading external files (e.g., from GitHub). (logical)}

\item{log_level}{Character vector of log levels to display. Can include `"info"`, `"error"`, `"event"`, or be set to `"none"` or an empty vector to disable logging.}

\item{log_target}{Destination for log messages: `"console"` or `"app"`. (character)}

\item{port}{Port used to run the Shiny app. (integer)}

\item{host}{Host address to run the app on. Default is `"0.0.0.0"`. (character)}

\item{loading_options}{A list of startup options (e.g., page, project, subset to load). Should include named elements like `page`, `project_id`, `load_data_page`, `subset_id`, `person_id`.}

\description{
Launches the LinkR Shiny application for health data science. \cr
You can configure the interface language, authentication mode, runtime behavior, and logging preferences.\cr

Use `language` to set the application language (`"en"` or `"fr"`). \cr
Use `app_folder` to define where LinkR will store application data and configuration files. 
If not specified, a `linkr` folder will be created in the user's home directory. \cr

Use `log_level` to control which log messages are displayed. It accepts a character vector containing any combination of:
`"info"` (standard information), `"error"` (errors only), and `"event"` (application lifecycle events). \cr
To disable all logs, use `"none"` or leave the argument empty. \cr

Use `log_target` to define where logs are displayed: `"console"` (developer mode) or `"app"` (to display logs in the LinkR interface).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
linkr(log_level = c("info", "event"), log_target = "console")
linkr(log_level = "none")
linkr(log_level = character(0))  # same as disabling all logs
}

}
