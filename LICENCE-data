This package includes the full 100-patient version of the MIMIC-IV Demo OMOP dataset, which was downloaded on 2025-06-09 from:

https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo-omop/0.9/

The original dataset was created through the work of the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and members of the OHDSI community, who converted MIMIC-IV into the OMOP Common Data Model.

The dataset is distributed under the **Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0**:  
https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/

You are free to share, modify, and use this dataset, provided you attribute the original source and distribute any derivative works under the same license (ODbL 1.0).

**Modifications applied to the original dataset in this package**:
- The dataset contains all 100 patients from the original MIMIC-IV OMOP demo dataset.
- Renumbered the following identifiers to improve clarity and usability:
  - `person_id`
  - `visit_occurrence_id`
  - `visit_detail_id`

These changes were made solely to facilitate data exploration and are not intended to alter the content or structure of the original dataset.
